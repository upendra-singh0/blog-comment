# Blog-comment

- Developed a micro service architectured Blog post application.
- Implemented underlying multiple services to handle Blog Posts, comments & comment moderation.
- The client interface was developed using React.
- Implemented async communication between services to ensure modularity of different services.
- Implemented Event Bus architecture to ensure eventual consistency and availability of the application and avoid single point of failure.
